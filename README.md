# pokemonblueAI
AI that plays through Pokemon Blue

Made a lot of radical changes to my previous project. Basically starting over.

This runs via VBA-RR and a pokemon blue rom. Simply load up a lua script in VBA-RR and select 'main.lua' or 'test.lua' (currently does nothing but debug stuff, this is a work in progress)

Runs on Windows but I'm using a WINE emulator to code this on a Mac.

Dependencies:
