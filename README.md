# pokemonblueAI2.0
AI that plays through Pokemon Blue

Continuing from @alexwennerberg's Pok√©mon Blue AI. He did some great work in setting up most of the initial issues mainly making a note of key memory locations in RAM. The bot only gets to Viridian Forest at the moment. Hopefully I can further this as much as I can possibly do!

This runs via VBA-RR and a pokemon blue rom. Simply load up a lua script in VBA-RR and select 'main.lua' or 'test.lua' (currently does nothing but debug stuff, this is a work in progress)

Runs on Windows.

Dependencies:
busted lua test framework
